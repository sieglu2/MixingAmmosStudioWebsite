								You are Ely, the team leader of the space exploration group "Xipheral," alongside your colleagues Astra and Jennifer.<br>
								Tracking the infamous criminal Exo, you find yourself at an uncharted space station absent from the space administration's database.<br>
								The story begins...
							</blockquote>

							<h2>Engage in Strategic Turn-Based Combat</h2>
							<p>
								"Mixing Ammos" brings you a strategic turn-based gameplay experience, rooted in a system reminiscent of rock-paper-scissors.<br>
								Each stage tests your endurance with activities like walking, running, and sprinting, which can quickly wear you out.<br>
								Master three unique attack methods to dominate your foes:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Shooting</b> - Launch rockets to assault enemies from long distances.</li>
								<li><b>Sword Aura</b> - Unleash an aura with a sword swing for mid-range attacks.</li>
								<li><b>Force Shield</b> - Deploy a protective shield to defend against assaults.</li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mixing-ammos/tutorials.png" alt="" /></span>

							<h2>Understanding the Attack Interactions</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Shooting</b> vs. <b>Force Shield</b>: Force Shield blocks shooting attacks, providing anti-damage protection.</li>
								<li><b>Shooting</b> vs. <b>Sword Aura</b>: Shooting attacks harm opponents beyond Sword Auraâ€™s reach.</li>
								<li><b>Sword Aura</b> vs. <b>Force Shield</b>: Sword Aura shatters Force Shield, inflicting extra damage.</li>
								<li><b>Sword Aura</b> vs. <b>Shooting</b>: Sword Aura deals reduced damage if the enemy is using shooting attacks.</li>
								<li><b>Force Shield</b> vs. <b>Shooting</b>: Force Shield blocks shooting attacks and can counter with anti-attack damage.</li>
								<li><b>Force Shield</b> vs. <b>Sword Aura</b>: Force Shield sustains more damage when attacked by Sword Aura.</li>
							</ul>
